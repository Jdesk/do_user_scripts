{"name":"Do user scripts","tagline":"","body":"DigitalOcean User Scripts Library\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a collection of scripts that can be used to help provision\r\nyour Droplet on first boot. When creating a new Droplet, they can be provided as\r\n\"user data.\" To sign up for a free Digitalocean account visit [Digitalocean Free Trial](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=14421caf17a0)\r\n\r\n![DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/metadata/user-data.png)\r\n\r\nFor an introduction for the technologies involved, check out these articles from\r\n[the DigitalOcean Community](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/) as well as\r\nthe [upstream cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):\r\n\r\n* [An Introduction to Droplet Metadata](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-droplet-metadata)\r\n* [An Introduction to Cloud-Config Scripting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-cloud-config-scripting)\r\n* [How To Use Cloud-Config For Your Initial Server Setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-cloud-config-for-your-initial-server-setup)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nScripts in this repository can be in one of two formats, shell scripts and\r\ncloud-config files. In order to encourage simplicity and readability, it is\r\nhighly encouraged to use the declarative cloud-config file format when possible.\r\n\r\nEach directory must contain a README.md file describing the scripts contained\r\nwithin it, including the target platform and a description of any needed user\r\ninput. As these scripts are not interactive, please use the standardized\r\nformat of **`<%DESCRIPTIVE_NAME%>`** for variables that should be provided by\r\nthe user before running the script. (See the `examples/` directory.)\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis project is an experiment, and it won't be successful without your feedback.\r\nLet us know what you think by [opening an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalocean/do_user_scripts/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
